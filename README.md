#Extreme Programming Project

The product to be designed and built is a Banking System. The system consists of two parts:

* the **Front End**, an automated teller machine terminal for simple banking transactions.

* the **Back End**, an overnight batch processor to maintain and update a master banking account file.

Both parts will be run as console applications, that is, they are to be invoked from a command line and use text and text file input/output only.

The objective was to design, implement, document and
deliver a two-part software product. All phases to follow Extreme Programming philosophy as much as it applies - in particular,

* continuously maintained test suites as requirements and quality control

* pair programming of all code

* simplest possible solution to every problem

* continuous redesign and rearchitecting

* automation in testing and integration

* frequent integration and complete releases

The project was done in six phases.
Phases cover steps in the process of creating a quality software result in the context of an Extreme Programming process model.

1. Front End **Requirements**

2. Front End Rapid **Prototype**

3. Front End Requirements **Testing**

4. Back End Rapid **Prototype**

5. Back End Unit **Testing**

6. Integration and **Delivery**
