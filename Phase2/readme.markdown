#CSCI 3060/SOFE 3980 -Assignment 2 (Project Phase 2)

###Due date

February 22nd, 2016

###Objective
Design and rapidly program the first version the Front End. Do not do full testing of the Front End at this time - there will be no marks for "correctness". It should work well, but don't worry about getting it fully debugged or tested yet.

###Marking scheme and Progress

Out of ten. Distributed the following way:

| CATEGORY | MARKS /10 | STATUS | COMMENTS
| -------- | --------- | ------ | --------
| Design | - | <font color='red'>Pending</font> | Design document for Front End, showing the classes and methods in a UML class diagram and a description of the intention of each method and class in the form of a table.
|<ul><li><u>Architecture</u>: <br><br><ul><li>Clearly documents structure of solution</li><br><li>Explicitly descrives intention of each class and method</li><br><li>Accurately reflects solution structure</li><br><li>Clearly shows where inputs and outputs fit in</li></ul>| 2 marks |  -  | -
|<ul><li><u>Completeness</u>: <ul><br><li>Evidently adresses all required functionality (solution has parts to address all required operations and results)</li><br><li>Has specified inputs, outputs and files only. (Front end takes in transactions on std input, produces log on std output, has one input file - current accounts -, has one output file - daily transaction summary -.)</li></ul> | 2 marks | - | -
| Source Code | - | <font color='red'>Pending</font> | First version of the source code to implement the design. Should run on some inputs, but should <b>not</b> yet be completely tested.
|<ul><li><u>Structure and format</u>: <ul><br><li>Code is structured and formatted such that architecture is clearly visible in code</li><br><li>Naming of classes and methods clearly reflect their role in the solution</li><br><li>As little cloning or redundancy as possible</li></ul> | 2 marks | - | - |
|<ul><li><u>Maintainability</u>: <ul><br><li>Avoidance of coding tricks and hacks</li><br><li>Simplest solution possible, no frills and extras</li><br><li>Clearest solution possible, no gratuitus optimizations</li></ul> | 2 marks | - | -
|<ul><li><u>Internal Documentation</u>: <br><br><ul><li>Clear naming of all variables and constants to reflext their role in the solution</li><br><li>Comments at beginning of every class and method clearly documenting their interface and intention</li><br><li>Comment at beginning of main program documenting overall program intention, input and output files, and how the program is intented to be run</li></ul> | 2 marks | - | -
